## üöÄ Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**  
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.  
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.  
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.  
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.  
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### üî∏ Data Warehouse

**1. Bronze Layer**  
- Stores raw data *as-is* from the source systems.  
- Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.  
- **Object Type**: Tables  
- **Load**: Batch Processing, Full Load, Truncate & Insert  
- **Transformations**: None  
- **Data Model**: None (as-is)  

**2. Silver Layer**  
- Includes **data cleansing, standardization, and normalization** processes to prepare data for analysis.  
- **Object Type**: Tables  
- **Load**: Batch Processing, Full Load, Truncate & Insert  
- **Transformations**:  
  - Data Cleansing  
  - Data Standardization  
  - Data Normalization  
  - Derived Columns  
  - Data Enrichment  
- **Data Model**: None (as-is)  

**3. Gold Layer**  
- Houses **business-ready data** modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.  
- **Object Type**: Views  
- **Load**: No Load  
- **Transformations**:  
  - Data Integrations  
  - Aggregations  
  - Business Logic  
- **Data Model**:  
  - Star Schema  
  - Flat Table  
  - Aggregated Table  

### üìä Consumption
